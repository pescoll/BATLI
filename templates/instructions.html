        <h3>What is BATLI?</h3>
        <p>BATLI stands for <i>'Backtracking Analysis of Time-Lapse Images'</i>. This bioinformatics tool is designed for the retrospective analysis of dynamic cellular activities using time-lapse microscopy.</p> 
        <p>BATLI specializes in quantitative measurements within high-content assays and can backtrack properties such as fluorescence and morphology in individual cells, including various subcellular structures such as nuclei, mitochondria, lysosomes, or intracellular bacteria. This tool enables the classification of cellular fates based on a single dynamic parameter, subsequently examining all other parameters through retrospective analysis for each identified category of cellular fate.</p>        
        <p>Using BATLI, you have the capability to link certain dynamic parameters observed at the start of the time-lapse with specific cellular outcomes observed at the conclusion of the time-lapse. It's important to note that while these correlations can be revealing, they do not necessarily establish a cause-and-effect relationship. However, the insights gained from BATLI can indicate which parameters might be directly associated with particular cellular fates. This information is valuable as it can be utilized to develop predictive models for specific cellular outcomes.</p>
        <h3>Preparing Datasets for BATLI Analysis</h3>        
        <ol>
            <li>Collect time-lapse images using automated confocal microscopy</li>
            <li>Identify cellular compartments through image segmentation</li>
            <li>Track single cells in time</li>
            <li>Export single-cell data as a CSV file, including all measured parameters and single-cell ID of tracked cells</li>
            <li>BATLI is designed to work without problems with datsets generated by <a href="https://www.perkinelmer.com/fr/product/harmony-4-9-office-license-hh17000010" target="_blank">Harmony 4.9</a> (Perkin Elmer) for image analysis and cell tracking</li>
            <li>You have the option to utilize open-source software such as <a href="https://cellprofiler.org/" target="_blank">Cell Profiler</a> or <a href="https://imagej.net/plugins/trackmate/" target="_blank">TrackMate</a> for image analysis and cell tracking tasks. Ensure that the BATLI code is modified appropriately to accurately interpret the CSV files exported from these tools</li>
            <li>Once your dataset is prepared, you are ready to unlock the full potential of Backtracking your time-lapse experiments</li>
        </ol>

    <p>BATLI is composed of 4 modules that are normally used sequentially: ‘Cleaner’, ‘Loader’, ‘Viewer’, and ‘Backtracking’</p>

    <section class="section">
        <img src="./static/cleaner.png" alt="Cleaner Figure" class="figure-placeholder">
        <div class="content">
            <h3>Cleaner</h3>
            <p>This module imports the CSV dataset from the image analysis and automatically adjusts it for subsequent use. In this module, you can rename specific parameters (columns in your CSV) to make them shorter or more descriptive. These revised names will then be displayed. The 'Cleaner' module is designed to standardize datasets acquired from various equipment and analyzed through different image analysis pipelines, such as those combining automated time-lapse microscopy with image analysis tools like CellProfiler or TrackMate.</p>

    <section class="section">
        <img src="./static/loader.png" alt="Loader Figure" class="figure-placeholder">
        <div class="content">
            <h3>Loader</h3>
            <p>Use the 'Loader' module to import cleaned CSV datasets. This module displays the metadata of the dataset, offering a summary of the conducted experiment. It reveals the number of wells analyzed, the count of timepoints, and the number of single-cell trajectories examined in each well. Additionally, the module presents a table showcasing all the columns along with the first 20 rows of your dataset for your review and supervision. If you need to rename any parameter (column), you can return to the 'Cleaner' module to make those changes.</p>
        </div>

    <section class="section">
        <img src="./static/viewer.png" alt="Viewer Figure" class="figure-placeholder">
        <div class="content">
            <h3>Viewer</h3>
            <p>In the 'Viewer' module, users can select various parameters from the dataset, such as bacterial vacuole size (sum of the area occupied by GFP-expressing bacteria) or cell death (Annexin V intensity in the cytoplasm), and visualize singel-cell trajectories from the tracked time-lapse, high-throughput imaging experiments. Additionally, the 'Viewer' offers multiple normalization methods for data analysis. These include normalization to the first timepoint, custom normalization to a chosen range of timepoints, delta normalization which calculates the increment of each timepoint relative to the previous one, and curve fitting which smooths the data curve using polynomial regression.</p>

    <section class="section">
        <img src="./static/backtracking.png" alt="Backtracking Figure" class="figure-placeholder">
        <div class="content">
            <h3>Backtracking</h3>
            <p>The ‘Backtracking’ module classifies the trajectories according to a defined cellular fate (bacterial replication, cell death, differentiation, increment of a marker, etc) and a threshold triggering the classification of trajectories fates in two classes. Once the classification criteria is set, the second part of this last module performs backtracking (retrospective) analyses of each parameter measured in each class. The outputs of the software are single cell datasets organized according to cell fate classes and selected measured parameters in the backtracking analysis. Graphs show the progression of single cell cellular parameters in time, being colored-grouped by their class (fate). Bold lines represent the median value of the selected parameter at each time point for each class (class_0 and class_1). Shaded areas represent the 95% confidence interval around the median, calculated using bootstrapping. Light Red and Blue lines are the individual single-cell trajectories for class_1 (red) and class_0 (blue) cells. All the results are downloadable as figures (PNG files) and tables (CSV files) by clicking "Download Results".</p>
