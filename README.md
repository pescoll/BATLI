# BATLI: Backtracking Analysis of Time-Lapse Images

BATLI stands for **Backtracking Analysis of Time-Lapse Images**. It is a bioinformatics tool designed for the retrospective analysis of dynamic cellular activities using time-lapse microscopy. BATLI specializes in quantitative measurements within high-content assays and can backtrack properties such as fluorescence and morphology in individual cells, including various subcellular structures like nuclei, mitochondria, lysosomes, or intracellular bacteria.

Using BATLI, you can classify cellular fates based on a single dynamic parameter and examine all other parameters through retrospective analysis for each identified category of cellular fate. This tool enables you to link certain dynamic parameters observed at the start of the time-lapse with specific cellular outcomes observed at the conclusion of the time-lapse. While these correlations can be revealing, they do not necessarily establish a cause-and-effect relationship. However, the insights gained from BATLI can indicate which parameters might be directly associated with particular cellular fates, valuable for developing predictive models for specific cellular outcomes.

For more details, please refer to the [BATLI paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.10.28.620606v1.full.pdf+html).

BATLI has been developed by Mariatou Dram√©, Dmitry Ershov, Jean-Yves Tinevez and Pedro Escoll (Institut Pasteur, Paris)

## BATLI Modules

BATLI is composed of four modules that are typically used sequentially:

1. **Cleaner**
2. **Loader**
3. **Viewer**
4. **Backtracking**

### Cleaner

The **Cleaner** module imports the CSV dataset from your image analysis and automatically adjusts it for subsequent use. In this module, you can rename specific parameters (columns in your CSV file) to make them shorter or more descriptive. These revised names will then be displayed in the subsequent modules. The Cleaner module is designed to standardize datasets acquired from various equipment and analyzed through different image analysis pipelines, such as those combining automated time-lapse microscopy with image analysis tools like [CellProfiler](https://cellprofiler.org/) or [TrackMate](https://imagej.net/plugins/trackmate/).

### Loader

Use the **Loader** module to import cleaned CSV datasets. This module displays the metadata of the dataset, offering a summary of your experiment. It reveals the number of wells analyzed, the count of timepoints, and the number of single-cell trajectories examined in each well. Additionally, the module presents a table showcasing all the columns along with the first 20 rows of your dataset for review. If you need to rename any parameter (column), you can return to the Cleaner module to make those changes.

### Viewer

In the **Viewer** module, you can select various parameters from the dataset, such as bacterial vacuole size or cell death markers, and visualize single-cell trajectories from your tracked time-lapse imaging experiments. The Viewer offers multiple normalization methods for data analysis:

- **Normalization to the first timepoint**
- **Custom normalization to a chosen range of timepoints**
- **Delta normalization** (calculates the increment of each timepoint relative to the previous one)
- **Curve fitting** (smooths the data curve using polynomial regression)

### Backtracking

The **Backtracking** module classifies the trajectories according to a defined cellular fate (e.g., bacterial replication, cell death, differentiation) and a threshold that triggers the classification of trajectories into two classes. Once the classification criteria are set, this module performs backtracking (retrospective) analyses of each parameter measured in each class.

Outputs include:

- **Single-cell datasets** organized according to cell fate classes and selected measured parameters
- **Graphs** showing the progression of single-cell parameters over time, color-grouped by their class:
  - **Bold lines** represent the median value of the selected parameter at each timepoint for each class.
  - **Shaded areas** represent the 95% confidence interval around the median, calculated using bootstrapping.
  - **Light red and blue lines** are the individual single-cell trajectories for class_1 (red) and class_0 (blue) cells.
- All results are downloadable as **figures (PNG files)** and **tables (CSV files)** by clicking "Download Results".

## Preparing Datasets for BATLI Analysis

To use BATLI effectively, prepare your datasets as follows:

1. **Collect time-lapse images** using automated confocal microscopy.
2. **Identify cellular compartments** through image segmentation.
3. **Track single cells over time**.
4. **Export single-cell data** as a CSV file, including all measured parameters and single-cell IDs of tracked cells.
5. BATLI is designed to work seamlessly with datasets generated by [Harmony 4.9](https://www.perkinelmer.com/fr/product/harmony-4-9-office-license-hh17000010) (PerkinElmer) for image analysis and cell tracking.
6. Alternatively, you can use open-source software like [CellProfiler](https://cellprofiler.org/) or [TrackMate](https://imagej.net/plugins/trackmate/) for image analysis and cell tracking tasks. Ensure that you modify the BATLI code appropriately to accurately interpret the CSV files exported from these tools.
7. Once your dataset is prepared, you're ready to unlock the full potential of backtracking your time-lapse experiments with BATLI.
